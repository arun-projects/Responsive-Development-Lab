# Responsive Development Lab

- In this lab we will be practicing the fundamentals of responsive development by taking two fixed-width layouts and converting them to responsive layouts.
- Download the starter files here before getting started.
- Your job is to take the templates in layout_1 and layout_2 folders and make them responsive using a combination of techniques.
- **Bonus:** As a bonus, use the mockup in the layout_3 folder to create your own responsive layout from scratch.
